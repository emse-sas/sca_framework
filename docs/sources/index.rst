Welcome to SCAbox's documentation !
***************************************************************

SCAbox is an FPGA-based side-channel analysis framework dedicated to research and educational purposes. 

SCAbox aims at popularizing hardware security by enabling  SCA  experiments at low-cost using software-based hardware attacks. With the SCAbox framework you will be able to:

- **Familiarize** with SCA and co-design development.
- **Reproduce** attacks conducted in recent academic papers.
- **Build** your own FPGA-based side-channel sensors.
- **Characterize** the SCA leakage of your hardware and software algorithm implementation

For more information please check out our paper introducing SCAbox: PAPER_PATH
