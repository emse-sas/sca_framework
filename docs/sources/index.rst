Welcome to SCAbox's documentation !
***************************************************************

SCAbox is an FPGA-based side-channel analysis framework dedicated to research and educational purposes. 

SCAbox aims at popularizing hardware security by enabling  SCA  experiments at low-cost using software-based hardware attacks. With the SCAbox framework you will be able to:

- Familiarize with SCA and co-design development.
- Reproduce attacks conducted in recent academic papers.
- Build your own FPGA-based side-channel sensors.
- Characterize  the  SCA  leakage  of  your  hardware  andsoftware algorithm implementation
